The body hair is not disordered or anything, it feels as if he has been brushed recently - it all follows a pattern, lying vertically on his light surface. <br/>A surface that, at first glance, looks just as bright as the others. <br/>Although this is not the case.<br/><br/>I noticed that he was trying to turn his back discreetly in my direction. I don't know, it seems strange. What is he trying to hide? He's still in his underwear. ")

Not only is there still a lot of red blood showing his injuries, but the cuts seem to be irregular in depth: they were not made after a single blow. The knife made a couple of passes near the same area as the first cut, but not exactly along the path it must have followed. It is clear that other attempts not only made the first cut deeper, but also made it have more afluents coming out of its main blood stream.")
